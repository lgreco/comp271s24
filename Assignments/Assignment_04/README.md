# Assignment 4

As with *every assignment* in this course, you cannot import anything to your code. For this assignment you cannot use `java.util.ArrayList`. Furthermore, you cannot use any `System` function except for `System.out` print statements where and when needed. Finally, your code should not use any `for`-loops.

You can test your work by running `SimpleTesting.main`.
