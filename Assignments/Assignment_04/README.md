# Assignment 4

As with *every assignment* in this course, you cannot import anything to your code. For this assignment you cannot use `java.util.ArrayList`. Furthermore, you cannot use any `System` function except for `System.out` print statements where and when needed. Finally, your code should not use any `for`-loops.

Your code must be compliant with the Programmers Pact, as much as possible.

You can test your work by running `SimpleTesting.main`.

## Search for a station

Using classes `Station` and `TrainLine` in folder `Week_05`, write a method called `contains` that returns true if a station with a specified name exists in a `TrainLine` object and false otherwise.

## Design (specify) the string representation of `TrainLine`

If you attempt to print a `TrainLine` object, the result will be something like<br/>
```
TrainLine@ad4fe7
```

Propose a better way to represent a `TrainLine` object. Your proposal should be specific enough that an intermediate developer could execute it. Focus on what would you like the representative string to look like.

Write your proposal as a plain text file or as a MarkDown file, in your repository.

*Hint:* you may want to propose/design a `toString` method for class `Station` first.

Again, there is no need to write code for these methods, yet.
