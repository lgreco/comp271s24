# Assignment 7

As with *every assignment* in this course, you cannot import anything to your code. Furthermore, you cannot use any `System` function except for `System.out` print statements where and when needed. Finally, your code should not use any `for`-loops.

Your code must be compliant with the Programmers Pact, as much as possible.

## Implement a queue and a stack using a linked list

Class `SimpleLinkedList` in this folder implements the two interfaces we discussed in class during week 8. 

Your job is to write the methods specified in the two interfaces.

The most challenging part of this assignment is the design -- the work you need to do on paper, on a drawing up, on a whiteboard etc. Once you have done that, the coding should take 10-20 minutes. It is *critical* to reflect on the nature of the underlying structure we use here (a linked list) versus the one we used in the class examples (an array).

Testing code will be provided in a few days -- no later than Monday 7/15.
