# Assignment 3

For this assigment, modify class `DynamicArray` to implement interface `BasicTools`. The interface, for now, specifies only one method that you need to implement.

Implementing one method may sound easy, and the solution to this problem is not very complicated. But it requires some thinking and design first. Your analysis needs to be documented, in Javadoc-style comments on top of the method you write.

As with *every assignment* in this course, you cannot import anything to your code. Furthermore, you cannot use any `System` function except for `System.out` print statements where and when needed. There is no need for printing in this assignment. Finally, your code should not use any `for`-loops.

You can test your work by running `SimpleTesting.main`.
